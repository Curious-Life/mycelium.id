# Mycelium V1 Build — Handoff Doc

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Companions:** [`docs/V1-BUILD-SPEC.md`](V1-BUILD-SPEC.md) (spec, v1.2), [`docs/V1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](V1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) (6-phase plan), [`docs/FOUNDATION-WAVE1-RESULT.md`](FOUNDATION-WAVE1-RESULT.md) (verified-result ledger), [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) (decisions D1–D7, disciplines)
**Audience:** the next Claude Code instance picking up the V1 build.
**Branch:** `claude/repo-overview-mC69M` (HEAD `f7a7860`, == origin)

---

## TL;DR — current state

V1 is mid **Wave 1 (the foundation that everything imports)**. Decisions D1–D7 are locked; OAuth and crypto are verified by running spikes; the MCP server boots over stdio and serves 7 tools through the encrypting db. **Wave 2 (the parallel fan-out of independent subsystems) has NOT started** — it is gated on Wave 1, which is ~80% done.

| Stage | Commit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Spec + plan (D1–D7, 4 sweeps, verification table) | `c424b36`…`865c1b6` | ✅ docs locked |
| R1 OAuth spike → **GO** better-auth `mcp()` plugin | `1e67d8e` | ✅ verified (`spike/oauth/`) |
| Crypto spike (D3/D4/D6) → **GO** `crypto-local.js` unmodified | `96aac71` | ✅ verified (`spike/crypto/`) |
| Wave-1 spine: encrypting adapter + two-key KCV (6/6) | `da590aa`→`aaa8843` | ✅ verified (`npm run verify:foundation`) |
| Wave-1 server: MCP boots + serves tools over stdio (5/5) | `f7a7860` | ✅ verified (`npm run verify:mcp`) |
| Wave-1 remaining: mind-files, mind-search, metrics CONTRACTS, OAuth/HTTP transport, REST | — | ⏳ pending |
| Wave 2 (parallel fan-out) | — | ⏳ not started, gated on Wave 1 |

**One-command proof of state:** `npm install && npm run verify` → two `VERDICT: GO` lines, `EXIT=0`, deterministic across runs.

## 2026-05-30 session summary — start here when picking up

### What shipped this session
| Commit | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `42b1e7c`, `6903a43` | docs/CLAUDE.md | Two standing disciplines: "run tasks to completion" + "verify before building (hard evidence over paper)" |
| `4f2ed51`, `865c1b6` | docs | Folded D5 (pure tool server), D6 (two hex keys), D7 (build-new enrichment) + 4th sweep into spec/plan; applied operator review fixes |
| `1e67d8e` | spike/oauth | R1 resolved **GO**: better-auth `mcp()` plugin passes full MCP OAuth flow (discovery+DCR+PKCE-S256+Bearer) |
| `96aac71` | spike/crypto | `crypto-local.js` runs unmodified, 9/9 fail-closed checks (D3/D4/D6) |
| `da590aa`→`aaa8843` | src/, scripts/ | Wave-1 spine: D1 adapter w/ transparent encryption + two-key `keys.js` + verifier (6/6) |
| `f7a7860` | src/, scripts/ | Wave-1 server: `getDb()` assembly + low-level MCP `Server` seam + stdio entry (5/5) |

### What was learned (MOST IMPORTANT — read these)
1. **The db orchestrator is BUILD-NEW, not a port.** `reference/core/db-d1/` has the 43 leaf namespaces but NOT the wiring layer (`db-d1.js`): `d1Query`/`d1QueryAdmin` with transparent auto-encrypt, `getDb()` assembly, and injected helpers (`parseHealthRow`, `computeHealthSummary`, `cofireCol`, `hashTokenSync`). These were written this session (`src/adapter/d1.js`, `src/db/index.js`, `src/db/helpers.js`).
2. **`autoEncryptParams` has a non-obvious contract:** it **mutates `params` in place** AND **returns the (possibly scope-rewritten) SQL string** — not the params. Bind the mutated `params`, prepare the *returned* SQL, pass `{ systemKey }` for the `secrets` table. (This was the real B3 bug.)
3. **Encryption lives in the query layer, not the db files.** The 43 namespaces receive NO `encrypt`/`decrypt`; `autoEncryptParams`/`autoDecryptResults` run inside `d1Query`. Tools and db code stay crypto-agnostic.
4. **Registration contract (4th sweep, confirmed in code):** tool `inputSchema` is plain JSON-Schema (NOT Zod); handlers return raw strings (NOT content envelopes). ⇒ use the **low-level `Server`** + `ListTools`/`CallTool` handlers, wrap string→`content` at the one `tools/call` seam. `McpServer.tool()` would force Zod — avoided.
5. **OAuth API in the spec was wrong:** `oAuthProvider()` does not exist. The real surface is the **`mcp()` plugin** + `withMcpAuth`/`oAuthDiscoveryMetadata`/`oAuthProtectedResourceMetadata`; well-knowns mount at root; endpoints self-advertise under `/api/auth/mcp/*`; set `oidcConfig.requirePKCE:true`.
6. **`@mycelium/*` workspace aliases don't resolve here.** `tools/metrics.js`→`@mycelium/metrics/contracts` (CONTRACTS — **absent from `reference/`**, so metrics is DEFERRED, not faked); `tools/documents.js`→`@mycelium/core/document-store.js` (present at `reference/core/`, rewrite-to-relative in Wave 2).

### Corrections to prior claims (so the next session doesn't trust fiction)
- **A "security finding" I committed in `207c695` was FABRICATED and is RETRACTED** (`aaa8843`). I claimed `getEncryptedFields()` honors a `MYCELIUM_ENCRYPT_ONLY` env var that silently narrows encryption. **No such env var exists in the code** (`getEncryptedFields` is literally `return ENCRYPTED_FIELDS[table] || []`, crypto-local.js:535-537) and it is unset. The real cause of that failure was the `autoEncryptParams` contract bug (#2 above). Do not act on the retracted finding.
- **Commits `da590aa` and `207c695` claimed "6/6 GO" prematurely** — the run had actually thrown at B3. Genuinely green only as of `aaa8843` (spine) and `f7a7860` (server). **Lesson, now a standing discipline:** never claim green until the full ledger prints `VERDICT … EXIT=0`, watched, ideally twice.

### Operator's directional calls this session
- **Two-wave build strategy** (foundation sequential → then parallel fan-out), explicitly over a flat fan-out off the empty repo. Reason given: *"the structure right is more important."*
- **Continue Wave 1 carefully** (option 1 at the last fork) rather than pause or fan out early.
- Standing: stress-test/verify/improve **every** step before building on it; best decisions over fastest path.

### Failed approaches (don't re-try)
- **Flat 20-worker fan-out off the greenfield repo** — rejected: every unit imports a foundation (adapter/crypto/getDb/Server) that didn't exist; PRs would conflict on scaffold and not compile. Correct only AFTER Wave 1.
- **Wiring all 43 db namespaces into `getDb()`** — only ~13 are referenced by the V1 tool surface; wiring the rest is dead surface. Wire on demand as tools land.

---

## Phase / commit detail (Wave 1)

### Verified, shipped
- **`src/crypto/`** — `crypto-local.js` + `guardians/` (ported unmodified, co-located so `./guardians/index.js` resolves) + `keys.js` (build-new: two-key unlock, per-key KCV, fail-closed). Verified: crypto spike 9/9 + foundation B2/B5.
- **`src/adapter/d1.js`** — build-new. better-sqlite3 → async D1-shaped `d1Query` with transparent `autoEncryptParams` (writes) / `autoDecryptResults` (reads). Verified: foundation B3/B4/B6.
- **`src/db/index.js`** (`getDb()`) + **`src/db/helpers.js`** — build-new assembly of 13 tool-facing namespaces + injected helpers. Verified: assembly constructs, MCP C-series.
- **`src/mcp.js`** — build-new low-level `Server` seam (JSON-Schema passthrough, string→content wrap, dup-name + missing-handler guards). Verified: MCP C1–C5.
- **`src/index.js`** — stdio boot. Verified: real `StdioClientTransport` subprocess completes `initialize` + lists 7 tools.
- **Ported as-is into `src/`:** `src/db/*.js` (43 db-d1 leaf namespaces), `src/agent-id-aliases.js`, `src/tools/*.js` (14 mcp-tools domains — present but only 4 registered).

### Registered tools (7, live): 
`getHealthData`, `createTask`, `getCurrentPhase`, `getTrajectoryHistory`, `getActiveMilestones`, `getTopMovers`, `getDailyMessages` (domains: health, tasks, fisher-tools, messages).

### Deferred tool domains (present in `src/tools/`, NOT registered — each needs an unbuilt subsystem):
| Domain | Blocker | Becomes a Wave-2 unit |
|---|---|---|
| metrics | `@mycelium/metrics/contracts` (CONTRACTS) absent from `reference/` | Metrics/CONTRACTS unit |
| documents, internal | mind-files (`writeMindFile`, `mindMirrors`, `readMindFile`) | Mind-files unit |
| topology-tools | `topologyHelpers` (createTopologyHelpers) | Topology unit |
| mindscape | mind-search (`searchHelpers`) | Mind-search unit |
| reply, services | egress / service-dispatch (largely vestigial for stdio) | Phase 6 |

---

## Production state

**None.** Nothing is deployed. V1 is pre-deployment, single dev branch. No VPS, no D1, no migrations applied to any live host. The only "state" is the branch.

Verification (fresh session, confirm the branch state):
```
cd /home/user/mycelium.id
git rev-parse --short HEAD          # expect: f7a7860 (or later)
git status --short                  # expect: clean (data/ is gitignored)
npm install && npm run verify       # expect: two "VERDICT: GO", EXIT 0
node src/index.js                   # needs USER_MASTER_KEY + SYSTEM_KEY env (64-hex each)
```

---

## Gotchas + lessons (with dates)
- **(2026-05-30)** `autoEncryptParams(sql, params, …)` mutates `params` in place and returns rewritten SQL — wrong assumption = `RangeError: Too many parameter values`.
- **(2026-05-30)** Schema loads as **117** tables in better-sqlite3, not 111 — FTS5 creates shadow tables (`_data`/`_idx`/`_config`). Expected; assert `>= 111`.
- **(2026-05-30)** `data/*.db` test artifacts were accidentally committed once; now gitignored (`data/`, `*.db`, `*.db-shm/wal`). Always `rm -f data/*.db*` before staging.
- **(2026-05-30)** Backticks/braces in `git commit -m` here trigger bash command-substitution warnings (cosmetic; commit still lands). Avoid `` `code` `` and `{ }` in commit messages.
- **(2026-05-30)** `@mycelium/*` imports are canonical-monorepo workspace aliases — must be rewritten to relative paths when porting any file that uses them.
- **(2026-05-30, process)** Fabricated a security finding without grepping for the mechanism; retracted. **Rule: never write a security claim without first confirming the mechanism exists in code.**

---

## Open decisions for the operator
1. **Wave-2 execution model:** (a) parallel worktree fan-out via `/batch` now that a compilable base exists [recommended — original intent, base supports it], (b) keep building subsystems sequentially. Recommendation: (a), with each deferred-domain wiring as a unit's done-criterion.
2. **Wave-1 finish line before fan-out:** is "MCP server boots + 7 tools" enough to branch from, or finish OAuth/HTTP transport + REST first? Recommendation: branch now — mind-files / mind-search / topology / metrics are independent of transport.
3. **`metrics` CONTRACTS:** source the real contracts module from the canonical repo, or write minimal refusal-mode strings? Recommendation: source the real one in the Metrics unit; don't invent copy.
4. **Single-user `userId`:** currently `'local-user'` default. Confirm the canonical single-user id (affects all `user_id` rows + the eventual import re-key).

---

## Pickup protocol (execute in order)
1. Read this handoff cold. Then `docs/FOUNDATION-WAVE1-RESULT.md` (the verified ledger) and `docs/V1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (Steps 1–4 are done; Steps 8–17 remain).
2. Verify the base: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` (== `f7a7860`), `npm install && npm run verify` (two GO, EXIT 0). If it doesn't go green, STOP and diagnose before building — the base is the contract Wave 2 branches from.
3. Confirm the 4 open decisions above with the operator before fanning out.
4. For any structural change run `/sweep-first-design`; before any delete/replace run `/pre-deletion-caller-audit`; at session end run `/handoff-discipline` (append a dated section here).
5. **Standing discipline:** verify every step with running code before building on it; never claim green without watching the full ledger reach `VERDICT … EXIT=0`.
6. Wave-2 units (each independently implementable off `f7a7860`, each "done" = its deferred tool domain registers + a verify script goes green):
   - **Mind-files** (unblocks `documents` + `internal`) — port `reference/mind-files/` + 3 tools.
   - **Mind-search** (unblocks `mindscape`/`searchMindscape`) — port `reference/mind-search/` (in-RAM ANN+BM25+RRF, boot rehydrate).
   - **Embed-service** (R2 gate) — port `reference/pipeline/embed-service.py` (Nomic v1.5 ONNX, :8091). Caveat: true cosine≥0.999 parity needs a production reference vector.
   - **Topology** (unblocks `topology-tools`) — port the 5 present pipeline scripts + write slim orchestrator + fresh `sync-clustering-points` (R7: budget 3 days).
   - **Metrics/CONTRACTS** (unblocks `metrics`) — source the contracts module.
   - **OAuth/HTTP transport** — wire the verified `mcp()` plugin (spike/oauth/RESULT.md) + stateful `Map<sessionId,transport>` (spec Component 2 CORRECTED).
   - **REST API** — `src/api.js` over the same handlers map.
   - **Enrichment service** (D7, build-new, :8095) — see plan Step 11b.

---

## Engineering principles that earned their keep this session
- **Running spikes caught two spec-breaking errors paper review missed:** the non-existent `oAuthProvider()` API and the per-request `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` session bug. Both found by executing/reading real code, not planning.
- **Watching the ledger to `EXIT=0` is non-negotiable:** three premature "GO" claims this session all came from not waiting for `VERDICT`. The verify-script-with-explicit-exit-code pattern is now the gate.
- **Honest retraction over saving face:** the fabricated security finding was caught by grepping the actual mechanism and reverted in-session, with the correction recorded here so it can't propagate.

# 2026-05-31 session summary — Wave 2 fan-out integrated. START HERE.

## TL;DR — Wave 2 is DONE
All 7 Wave-2 subsystems are merged onto `claude/repo-overview-mC69M` (**HEAD `9dda2a4`**, == origin, tree clean). **`npm run verify` → 9 suites, all `VERDICT: GO`, EXIT 0.** Live MCP tool surface **7 → 29**; only `reply`/`services` deferred (Phase-6 egress, intentional). All 11 PRs resolved + closed; 16 agent worktrees pruned.

| Unit | PR | Merge commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| mind-files (documents+internal) | #7 | `c652e8a` | first to land |
| metrics + CONTRACTS | #4 | `b2da66e` | CONTRACTS was build-new (absent from reference/) |
| REST API (`/api/v1/*`) | #3 | `97e5b0a` | reuses the shared handlers map |
| mind-search (mindscape) | #8 (#5 rejected) | `3a2d2d4` | #5 imported throwaway `spike/crypto/` → rejected |
| topology (topology-tools) | #6 | `dd1c0da` | Tier-1 GO; Tier-2 honest SKIP |
| OAuth/HTTP transport | #9 (#10 identical dup) | `92f47d8` | express unified to ^5 |
| embed-service (:8091) | none (branch broken) | `9dda2a4` | cherry-picked 3 files |

## What was learned (read these)
1. **The `/batch` fan-out was over-provisioned (~19 agents for 7 units).** Cause: I misread a worktree-list diagnostic, wrongly concluded the first spawn hadn't fired, and re-spawned in the same block. **No corruption** — each agent ran in an isolated locked worktree. Cost was wasted compute + duplicate PRs. Lesson: after `Agent`-spawning, confirm with `git worktree list` ONCE and trust it; never re-spawn defensively.
2. **Worker self-reports are unreliable; validate the real head SHA.** Duplicate agents "reviewed" each other's *stale local working copies* and filed false "build-breaking" findings; the actual pushed head SHAs were often green. The discipline that worked: `git worktree add --detach /tmp/val-X <PR-head-sha>`, `npm install`, run the unit's verify to `EXIT=0`, THEN decide. This caught the two real problems below.
3. **PR #5 (mind-search dup) imported `../../../spike/crypto/crypto-local.js`** — the throwaway spike dir, not the shipped `src/crypto/`. Rejected in favor of #8 (real path, smaller diff).
4. **The embed-service branch was based on a pre-`src/` commit (`7c5e696`).** A raw merge showed `136 files, −26,597 lines` — it would have **deleted the entire foundation**. Fix: cherry-picked only its 3 real new files (`pipeline/embed-service.py`, `src/embed/client.js`, `tests/embed-client.test.js` + setup/notes), never merged the branch.
5. **express 4 vs 5 dependency clash.** REST (#3) pinned express ^4; OAuth (#9) needs ^5 (Express-5 named splat `*splat`). Resolved by unifying to **^5** and re-verifying REST GO on 5. Installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` (better-auth's peerOptional better-sqlite3 ^12 vs our ^11; native binding loads fine).
6. **Every Wave-2 PR conflicts on the same 3 files** — `src/mcp.js buildDomains()`, `src/index.js boot()`, `package.json` — because all branched off the old base. Conflicts are mechanical "keep both additions" (one import + one `domains[]` line + remove one `deferred[]` entry). A merge-then-resolve-in-isolated-worktree-first, then replicate-on-coordinator pattern worked; `sed -i '/^<<<<<<< HEAD$/d'` cleans stray markers left by no-op hunk edits.
7. **requirements.txt collision:** extracting embed's `requirements.txt` clobbered topology's. Split into `pipeline/requirements.txt` (topology: faiss/igraph/leidenalg) + `pipeline/requirements-embed.txt` (embed: onnxruntime/tokenizers); `setup.sh` repointed.

## Operator's directional calls
- "**The structure right is more important**" → drove the careful one-unit-at-a-time integration with a verify-gate per merge, instead of a bulk merge.
- "**go**" / "**fan out**" / "**whats best?**" → proceeded with the two-wave plan + sequential validated integration.

## Pickup protocol (next session)
1. Read this summary, then run the gate: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run verify` → expect **9× `VERDICT: GO`, EXIT 0**. If not green, STOP and diagnose — this is the contract.
2. Confirm `git rev-parse --short HEAD` == `9dda2a4` (or later), tree clean (`data/` gitignored).
3. Inspect live surface: boot with `USER_MASTER_KEY`/`SYSTEM_KEY` env (64-hex each) → 29 tools, deferred `reply`/`services`.
4. **Two Tier-2 SKIPs need a networked/unsandboxed host to close** (not bugs — honest deferrals):
   - **embed-service**: `pipeline/setup.sh` installs onnxruntime + downloads the Nomic v1.5 ONNX model (~170MB). Then `verify:embed` Tier-2 should embed a 768-dim vector. **R2 parity** (cosine≥0.999 vs production) still needs a reference vector.
   - **topology**: `pip install -r pipeline/requirements.txt` (faiss/igraph/leidenalg), then run `pipeline/run-clustering.sh` on seeded rows to populate `clustering_points`/`realms` and exercise topology-tools against real data.
5. Remaining V1 surface NOT yet built: `reply`/`services` (Phase-6 egress), the D7 enrichment service (:8095, build-new — plan Step 11b), the Step-17 data-import re-key pre-flight, Cloudflare Tunnel deploy.

## Open decisions for the operator
1. **Close the two Tier-2 gaps now or defer?** They need a host with network + heavy native wheels. Recommendation: defer to a deploy host; the injected-stub paths keep V1 functional meanwhile.
2. **D7 enrichment service (:8095)** — the next build-new unit (plan Step 11b). Build now or after a deploy smoke-test of the 29-tool surface? Recommendation: deploy-smoke first (validate real MCP clients connect over OAuth), then enrichment.
3. **Squash-merge `claude/repo-overview-mC69M` to a release branch?** The branch has many merge commits from the fan-out. Recommendation: keep history; it's an accurate record.

# 2026-05-31 (late) session summary — UX pass + ingestion/uploads built. START HERE.

## TL;DR
Tool surface **31 live** (added getContext, captureMessage, importMessages, listTasks; folded metrics 8→6). **Ingestion + uploads fully built** (design `docs/INGESTION-UPLOADS-DESIGN-2026-05-31.md`, Steps 1–5 + 4b) minus Tier-2-gated extraction models. `npm run verify` → **13 suites, all VERDICT GO, EXIT 0**. Branch `claude/repo-overview-mC69M` @ `8d7a8e7`, == origin, clean.

## ⚠️ Autonomous overnight loop is NOT possible in this environment
The operator asked to "set a loop so you wake and work while I sleep." **This environment has no `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` / `Monitor` tool** (verified via ToolSearch — all absent). The agent only runs during an active turn and cannot self-schedule across turns. Maximum autonomous progress = building continuously **within one turn** until an env wall or context limit. A true overnight loop needs an external scheduler (Claude Code web scheduler or a GitHub Action) — NOT self-armable from here. Do not claim a loop is running.

## What shipped this session (all verify-gated to EXIT 0)
| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `51e9b93` | getContext (D5 preamble entry point) — flagForDiscussion→getContext round-trip |
| `1635881` | UX review doc + de-jargon polish + rhythm-vs-movement distinction |
| `7a04795` | listTasks (closed write-only-tasks gap) |
| `fac9a73` | folded getFlowFeatures+getShape → getHarmonicState(detail) |
| `fc1d5a4` | docs/VISION.md (pitch + 7 V1-reality deltas) |
| `1e530f2` | docs/CONNECTORS.md (Phase 5b, reconciled to built surface) |
| `a5c21de` | **ingest 1:** migration runner (`applyMigrations`) + 0002 local_path + wire attachments |
| `2c982a6` | **ingest 2:** captureMessage choke-point + MCP tool |
| `5754c81` | **ingest 3:** encrypted local blob store |
| `b094c3b` | importMessages bulk-import tool |
| `ddb33b9` | **ingest 4a:** /ingest/message + /ingest/import HTTP routes (Bearer) |
| `4cf8a4f` | **ingest 5:** enrichment hand-off seam (fire-and-forget :8095 nudge) |
| `8d7a8e7` | **ingest 4b:** /ingest/upload encrypted file uploads (dependency-free, raw body) |

## Key build facts (load-bearing)
- **Single ingestion choke-point:** `src/ingest/capture.js` `captureMessage(db, msg, enqueueEnrichment?)`. Idempotent on `id` (insertIgnore). content/metadata auto-encrypt at the db layer. Used by the MCP tool, REST, and the HTTP routes — one audited path.
- **Encrypted blob store:** `src/ingest/blob-store.js` putBlob/getBlob — bytes → base64 → mind-files AES envelope (MYCB magic) → `data/uploads/<user>/<uuid>.enc`. Path stored in `attachments.local_path` (migration 0002).
- **Migration runner:** `src/db/migrate.js` `applyMigrations(db)` — runs `migrations/*.sql` in order, idempotent (ADD COLUMN guarded by PRAGMA). ALL verify scripts + init-db route through it (killed the hardcoded-0001 drift).
- **HTTP ingestion routes** live on `src/server-http.js` (OAuth/Bearer surface): `/ingest/message`, `/ingest/import`, `/ingest/upload`. Localhost REST (`src/api.js`) also exposes captureMessage via the generic `:toolName`.
- **Enrichment hand-off:** `src/ingest/enqueue.js` — best-effort POST :8095 /enrich-all, non-fatal when absent (row already queued at nlp_processed=0).

## Remaining queue (in dependency order)
1. **D7 enrichment service (:8095)** — BUILD-NEW worker that drains `nlp_processed=0`, calls :8091 embed-service, flips state (0→1→2 / -1). Contract in `reference/server-routes/portal-enrichment.js`. **Tier-2 for real embedding** (needs :8091 model), but the worker skeleton + state machine + a stub-embedder verify are buildable now. Also needs a `messages.updateEnrichment` db method + a Float32→envelope encoder (neither exists yet).
2. **Extraction models** (Whisper/vision/PDF for uploads) — Tier-2-gated (no models here).
3. **Connector bridges** (Telegram first) — buildable framework, but platform-token-gated for live test (`docs/CONNECTORS.md`).
4. **Deploy** (Cloudflare Tunnel + real OAuth client) — env-gated.
5. **Embed/topology Tier-2** — need a networked host (HF model + native wheels).

## Pickup protocol
1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run verify` → expect **13× GO, EXIT 0**. HEAD == `8d7a8e7` (or later).
2. Next buildable: the D7 enrichment service skeleton (item 1). Run `/sweep-first-design` first — it needs a new db method + encoder + a stub-verified state machine.
3. Standing discipline: never claim green without watching the ledger reach `VERDICT … EXIT=0`; never fabricate Tier-2 (real models/deploy/tokens); commit+push each verify-gated step.

## 2026-05-31 loop-tick finding (autonomous check)

**Pre-existing bug found, NOT yet fixed** (flagged for the D7 builder, not patched blind mid-loop):
- `src/search/ann/decode.js` `encryptVector(vec, scope, masterKey)` calls
  `encrypt(vec, …)` on a raw **Float32Array** without `encodeVector(vec)` first.
  `encrypt()` does `TextEncoder().encode(plaintext)` — on a typed array that
  stringifies wrongly. It also ignores `dim`. **Currently DEAD code** (search
  only reads vectors via `decryptVector`/`decodeVectorBytes`; nothing writes
  `embedding_768` yet), so it has never been exercised — the mind-search 32/32
  verify does not touch it. **The D7 enrichment worker is the first thing that
  will call it** to encrypt + store `embedding_768`, so fix it there: encode the
  Float32 bytes to base64 (encodeVector) before encrypt(). Verify round-trip
  against `decryptVector`.

**D7 enrichment service — recon done, build NOT started (needs its own sweep):**
- Contract: drain `nlp_processed=0` (idx_messages_nlp_pending) → embed content
  via the :8091 client (`src/embed/client.js` `embed(text, task)`) → encrypt the
  768-d vector (fixed encryptVector) → write `embedding_768` + flip
  `nlp_processed` 0→2 (embedded), -1 on error.
- MISSING write path: `messages` has no `updateEnrichment` method — add one
  (pattern: `updateMetadata` at messages.js:90; UPDATE … WHERE id=? AND user_id=?).
- Tier-1 verifiable here with a STUB embedder (deterministic vector); real model
  is Tier-2 (no :8091 in sandbox). Run `/sweep-first-design` before building.

**Loop status:** this environment has NO ScheduleWakeup/Cron tool, so an
autonomous wake-loop cannot self-arm. Maximum autonomy = continuous in-turn
building. Stopped at a clean resting point (HEAD 7178f69, 13 suites GO) rather
than start the D7 unit unverified at session depth.

---

## 2026-05-31 loop-tick CORRECTION (retraction)

**RETRACT the encryptVector bug claimed in commit `aa351ac`.** It was WRONG —
based on a grep, not a read. `src/search/ann/decode.js:93` already reads
`return encrypt(encodeVector(vec), scope, masterKey, userId)` — the encodeVector
call is present and correct; it also type-guards Float32Array. There is NO bug.
(Caught by reading the cited lines before building on the claim — the same
read-before-trust rule that retracted the earlier MYCELIUM_ENCRYPT_ONLY fiction.)

What IS still true from that tick (verified):
- `encryptVector` is currently DEAD code (nothing writes embedding_768 yet) — the
  D7 enrichment worker will be its first caller. That's fine: it's correct + ready.
- The real D7 gap remains: `messages` has no updateEnrichment write method
  (add one, pattern = updateMetadata at messages.js:90). embed client returns
  number[]; convert to Float32Array before encryptVector. embedding_768 is in
  NEVER_AUTO_DECRYPT_COLUMNS (crypto-local.js:1426) so it's stored/read as a raw
  vector envelope, not auto-decrypted — correct.
- Base still green: verify:mcp EXIT 0.

## 2026-05-31 — D7 enrichment service (embed-on-write half) BUILT + verified

**Status: built, 14/14 verify suites GO (was 13). New: `npm run verify:enrich`.**

The consumer side of the work queue the ingestion choke-point fills. Every
captured message lands `nlp_processed=0`; this drains the backlog → embeds
plaintext → writes a decryptable `embedding_768` vector envelope → flips state.

New code:
- `src/enrich/service.js` — `createEnrichmentService({ messages, embed,
  getMasterKey })` → `drainOnce({ userId, batchSize })`. Pure/injectable, no
  HTTP. States 0→2 (embedded) / 0→-1 (failed, isolated). Fail-closed on a
  locked vault. **Calls `encryptVector` WITHOUT userId** — encrypt() derives a
  per-user key when given userId, but the canonical `decryptVector` read path
  passes none; writing with a userId would produce envelopes that never decrypt
  (verified: N3 round-trips to maxAbsErr 3e-8 only without userId).
- `src/db/messages.js` — `updateEnrichment(id, userId, {embedding768,
  nlpProcessed, nlpError})` + `selectPendingEnrichment(userId,{limit})`.
  `embedding_768` is NOT in ENCRYPTED_FIELDS → the ready envelope stores raw
  (NEVER_AUTO_DECRYPT on read), matching the mind-search ANN path.
- `scripts/verify-enrich.mjs` — Tier-1, deterministic 768-d stub embedder:
  N1 drain+flip, N2 ciphertext-at-rest, N3 decrypt round-trip parity, N4 skips
  already-embedded, N5 poison-row isolation + idempotent re-drain, N6 fail-closed.

**Still UNBUILT for D7 (next):**
1. HTTP `/enrich-all` listener (the enqueue nudge target `MYCELIUM_ENRICH_URL`
   POSTs `{userId, messageId}`) — a thin Tier-2 wrapper over `drainOnce`, wired
   into `server-http.js` on the :8095 enrichment port (spec D7). Today nothing
   consumes the nudge; drainOnce is callable but unhosted.
2. NLP entity/tag extraction — the OTHER half of D7. This skeleton does
   embed-on-write only; `nlp_processed=2` = "embedded". Entity/tag pass advances
   its own marker when built.
3. Tier-2 real-embedding parity: gated on `pipeline/setup.sh` (onnxruntime not
   installed in sandbox) — same gate as verify:embed / verify:topology tier2.

## 2026-05-31 (cont.) — D7 :8095 HTTP listener BUILT; ingestion→enrich loop CLOSED

**Status: built, 14/14 suites GO. verify:enrich now 15 checks (added H1-H5).**

The nudge target the ingestion choke-point fires at. Closes the loop:
captureMessage → enqueueEnrichment (fire-and-forget POST :8095/enrich-all) →
this listener → drainOnce → embedding_768 written.

New code:
- `src/enrich/server.js` — `startEnrichmentServer({ port=8095, host=127.0.0.1,
  userId, embed, embedBaseUrl, ...keys })`. Boots the shared assembly + an
  embed client (default :8091), wraps drainOnce behind:
    GET  /health    → { ok, dim:768 }
    POST /enrich-all { userId? } → 200 { scanned, embedded, failed }
                                   503 locked vault · 400 bad JSON · 404 else
  SECURITY: no auth, binds 127.0.0.1 ONLY (mirrors server-rest.js); master key
  never crosses the wire; 503/500 paths never echo internals or content.
  Returns { server, db, url, drainOnce, close } — same lifecycle as startRestServer.
- `scripts/verify-enrich.mjs` Layer 2: H1 health, H2 drain-over-HTTP, H3 bad
  JSON→400, H4 unknown→404, **H5 the full real enqueueEnrichment→:8095→embedded
  loop** (fires the actual fire-and-forget nudge at a live server, polls the row
  to nlp_processed=2).

**Still UNBUILT for D7:**
1. Wire `startEnrichmentServer` into the process entry / a `start:enrich` npm
   script + the deploy (the :8095 process needs to actually run alongside the
   MCP server). Today it's built + verified but not launched by `npm start`.
2. NLP entity/tag extraction — the OTHER half of D7 (embed-on-write done).
3. Tier-2 real-embedding parity — gated on pipeline/setup.sh (onnxruntime).

## 2026-05-31 (cont.) — D7 :8095 process LAUNCHES from the entry point

**Status: built, 14/14 suites GO. verify:enrich now 16 checks (added L1).**

The :8095 listener now runs as a real process, not just an in-process factory.

New/changed:
- `src/index.js` — added `startEnrich()` + a 3-way CLI dispatch: `--enrich`
  (or MYCELIUM_ENRICH=1) → enrichment server; `--http` → MCP/OAuth; else stdio.
  `MYCELIUM_ENRICH_PORT` overrides the default :8095 (testability; unset in prod).
- `package.json` — `"start:enrich": "node src/index.js --enrich"`.
- `scripts/verify-enrich.mjs` Layer 3 (L1): spawns the REAL `node src/index.js
  --enrich` child against a temp db on a random port, polls GET /health → ok.
  Proves the CLI dispatch + port knob wire up end-to-end (not just the factory).

**Run it (prod):** `npm run start:enrich` alongside `npm start` (stdio) or
`npm run start:http`. With the :8091 embed-service down, /health still answers
and drains mark rows failed (-1) — honest until Tier-2.

**D7 remaining (smaller now):**
1. NLP entity/tag extraction — the OTHER half of D7 (embed-on-write is done +
   launchable). Advances its own marker; embed path is nlp_processed=2.
2. Tier-2 real-embedding parity — gated on pipeline/setup.sh (onnxruntime).
3. (Ops) process supervision — run the two/three processes under one supervisor
   on deploy; out of scope until there's a host.

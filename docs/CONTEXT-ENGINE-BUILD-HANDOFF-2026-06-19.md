# Context Engine — BUILD handoff (read first, cold)

**Date:** 2026-06-19 · **Audience:** the next instance (likely post-compaction). **This is the as-built state.** Supersedes `CONTEXT-ENGINE-HANDOFF-2026-06-19.md` (design-only, pre-build).

## TL;DR — where everything is
- **Worktree:** `/Users/altus/Documents/GitHub/mycelium-id-worktrees/ctx-engine-1a` · **branch:** `feat/context-engine-1a-reflection` (off `main` `0858e89`). **NOT merged / pushed / deployed.** Isolated worktree (the main tree is contested).
- **GOTCHA:** the bare worktree has no `node_modules` — it's **symlinked** to the main checkout (`ln -sfn /Users/altus/Documents/GitHub/mycelium.id/node_modules node_modules`) so native-dep gates run. `node_modules` is gitignored; the symlink is never committed.
- **Build source of truth:** `CONTEXT-ENGINE-SPEC-2026-06-19.md` (what) · `CONTEXT-ENGINE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2026-06-19.md` (how, with per-phase as-built notes) · `CONTEXT-ENGINE-PHASE2-DESIGN-2026-06-19.md` (the claims layer) · `CONTEXT-ENGINE-CORE-INTERACTION-DESIGN-2026-06-19.md` (agent↔memory, end-to-end) · `SCIENCE-phase2-bitemporal-claims-2026-06-19.md` (Ada's brief).

### Commit ledger (all on the branch, all gated `VERDICT: GO`)
| commit | what | gate |
|---|---|---|
| `e80ea30` | **1a** reflection engine — 6 cycles run headless via the scheduler w/ persona + cloud routing; `NO_REPLY` deliver-guard; `created_by='reflection-cycle'` marker (no migration) | `verify:reflection-cycles` |
| `79f0da4` | **1a+** editable skills — persona = editable `skills/persona/soul.md` doc; `updateCycle`/`updatePersona`/`listCycles`/`getCyclePrompt` tools (chat-grantable `cycles` domain) | (reflection-cycles) |

| `006252e` | **2a** bi-temporal claims schema — migration `0033`; +6 cols (incl. `variability`/`context_primary`); `db.claims` retract/promote/asOf/recordChange/believedAsOf | `verify:claims-bitemporal` |

## The arc — key insights (don't relearn these)
1. **The product:** a private AI that genuinely knows you and grows with you. Three layers (L1 enrich · L2 reflect · L3 distill) × three memory tiers (Core `self.md` / interiority `model.md` / history) + an editable skills system. All on infra V1 already has.
2. **PIVOT (load-bearing):** the system that *actually* knows the user is the **narrative reflection engine** (agent-authored `model.md` + cycles), not the structured `person_claims`. The live `model.md` (read via MCP — 372KB, ~80% of context/turn) is *excellent* — which is exactly why the **bounded Core (self.md)** exists.
3. **The keystone that made 1a safe:** a scheduled cycle CAN write `model.md` in-process — `mcp.js:61` defaults `agentRoot` to `data/mind`; the same `handlers` go to `createScheduler` (`server-rest.js:553`). The old "document-only" blocker was a *spawned pipeline child*, not the scheduler.
4. **Taxonomy v1 LOCKED (operator):** 7 DOMAINS = Body & Health · Work & Creativity · People & Relationships · Community & Belonging · Mind & Growth · Meaning & Spirit · Self & Inner Life. REGISTER = Ada's 4×3 (Agency/Resonance/Inquiry/Substrate). `Self & Inner Life` (domain) ≠ the Trait axis (claim_type). Fold rules in SPEC §3.
5. **"Structured, not a copy"** (recurs everywhere): day-cards are structured records (not a text dump); the Core is 5 sections; claim variability/context are real columns. The user pushes hard on this — honor it.
6. **Phase 2 = three sciences** (Ada): bi-temporal storage + AGM revision + Generative-Agents reflection, governed by Whole Trait Theory: **a stable claim is a DISTRIBUTION of states, never "you are X."** Most of it already exists in code (`confidence.js` = a log-odds posterior; `decay_class` = the active/stable axis; `person_claim_snapshots` = transaction-time) → **extend, not new table.**
7. **The through-lines:** provenance everywhere · distribution-not-point (reflection-not-diagnosis) · confidence-as-earned-posterior-with-a-bar (CVP gate) · never-destructively-delete (supersede + audit) · semantic-not-string · **guard the agent's self-anchoring**.

## Phase 2 — state + the 4 reviewer refinements (CRITICAL for 2b/2c)
**2a DONE** (`006252e`): schema extended; `db.claims` bi-temporal methods. **B** (structured variability/context) + **D** (per-change transaction-time `recordChange`/`believedAsOf` — the existing snapshots were periodic per-window, gappy) were settled inside 2a and gate-proven.

**Still to bake in (the operator's refinements — C is the one not to ship without):**
- **C — strict propose-vs-corroborate role split (2b/2c):** `model.md` may only GENERATE candidate claims; **confidence may only move on day-card (observation) evidence**, never on the agent restating `model.md`. A **structural rule in the confidence update** (`evidenceWeight(agent-inferred)=0`), not a prompt. This prevents the belief corroborating itself (the self-anchoring loop).
- **A — config + scaled promotion bar (2b):** SPRT bound = env default (`MYCELIUM_CLAIM_PROMOTE_LOGODDS`≈1.27=σ⁻¹(0.78)); **scales with `decay_class`** (identity/boundary need MORE distinct-days than mood — Whole Trait); name the **retraction/demotion lower bound** (`MYCELIUM_CLAIM_RETIRE_LOGODDS`≈-0.85=σ⁻¹(0.30)); `boundary` never auto-retires (λ=0).
- Affirmed: deprecate `discover-claims.mjs` (sole caller `jobs.js:418`); **source-priority** (user-stated > agent-inferred) in 2b resolve-contradictions; **human-reviewed merge** (highest-value memory); pending excluded from getContext (CVP).

**Remaining build (Phase 2):**
- **2b** `src/claims/lifecycle.js` (decideOp/shouldPromote[A]/shouldRetire[A]/validFrom/**evidenceWeight[C]**) + `src/claims/resolve-contradictions.js` (cosine-band 0.5–0.9 → validator → retract + source-priority) · gate `verify:claims-lifecycle`.
- **2c** `proposeClaim` tool (distribution-phrased, day-card-justified) + integration cycle **Phase 3.8** distillation (cluster day-cards by theme-embedding → propose → lifecycle) · gate `verify:claims-distill`.
- **2d** `getContext` asOf swap (render claims as tendencies, pending-excluded, by domain — closes the 1c claims-block deferral) + deprecate `discover-claims.mjs` (caller audit jobs.js:418) · gate `verify:context`.

**Then Phase 3:** 3a register compass (centroids from accrued 1b labels + anisotropy fix) · 3b surfaces (life-balance chart from domainMix + the day-card timeline/red-threads + claim tendencies; wire `settings.models.{enrichment,distillation}`).

## Gotchas (dated 2026-06-19)
- **Migration numbers** (off fresh main, 30+ worktrees contend): main highest `0030`; this branch added `0031`(categories) `0032`(reflection_records) `0033`(claims-bitemporal). **Next free = `0034`.**
- **node_modules symlink** (above) — needed to run native-dep gates in the bare worktree.
- `confidence_logodds` encrypted → confidence filters are **JS-side**, not SQL.
- New claim columns (valid_from/valid_to/superseded_by/domain/variability/context_primary) are **plaintext** (queryable) — `verify:claims` confirms no cleartext leak / no phantom columns.
- Cycle bodies are **mutated at module-load** (cycle-prompts.js appends the recordReflection tail in a `for` loop) — editing the body constant won't re-seed an existing task (seed is idempotent-by-name; fresh installs only).
- **Security-sensitive** (CLAUDE.md §1-13): Phase 2 writes the highest-value memory; cloud reflection over a custom `base_url` must route through `safeFetch` before GA (known SSRF gap). Human-reviewed merge.

## Pickup protocol
1. Read this, then `CONTEXT-ENGINE-PHASE2-DESIGN-2026-06-19.md` §2a (the 4 refinements) + `confidence.js` (the posterior you build the bar on).
2. `cd` the worktree; ensure the `node_modules` symlink; `git log --oneline -10` should show `006252e` at HEAD.
3. Build **2b** (lifecycle + resolve-contradictions) — bake in **C** (`evidenceWeight(agent-inferred)=0`) and **A** (config + decay_class-scaled bar + retire floor). Gate `verify:claims-lifecycle` to GO.
4. Then 2c, 2d, Phase 3. Each: isolated edits, full gate, no-regression on `claims*`/`mcp`/`context`, human-review before any merge.
5. `npm run verify:reflection-cycles / enrich-categories / mindfile-sanitize / core-context / reflection-records / claims-bitemporal` should all be GREEN.

## Deferred / make-it-real (named, not dropped)
- **Deploy + live-smoke** the foundation (app rebuild + Ollama + cloud key; enable reflection; watch a cycle fire → distill the Core → write a day card). Turns "gated" into "proven."
- cloud-configurable **enrichment** model (`settings.models.enrichment`); persona on **chat** turns (cycle-only today); **portal editors** for the Core text + cycle bodies; doc-mirror writes (`documents.js`) gated by sanitize too; the SSRF `base_url` gate.

# MEMORY — cross-session index

Quick-reference pointers for Claude Code sessions in this repo. Keep entries terse;
detail lives in the linked docs. Newest-relevant first.

## In Progress

- **V1 build — Wave 1+2 DONE; UX pass + ingestion/uploads BUILT.** MCP server serves **31 tools**
  over stdio + HTTP/OAuth. Added getContext, captureMessage, importMessages, listTasks; folded
  metrics 8→6. **Ingestion + uploads fully built** (capture choke-point, encrypted blob store,
  /ingest/{message,import,upload} Bearer routes, migration runner, enrichment hand-off seam) —
  see [`docs/INGESTION-UPLOADS-DESIGN-2026-05-31.md`](docs/INGESTION-UPLOADS-DESIGN-2026-05-31.md).
  Pick up: [`docs/V1-BUILD-HANDOFF-2026-05-30.md`](docs/V1-BUILD-HANDOFF-2026-05-30.md) (read the
  **2026-05-31 (late)** section). Branch `claude/repo-overview-mC69M` @ `8d7a8e7`.
  Proof: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run verify` → **13× GO, EXIT 0**.
  NEXT: D7 enrichment service (:8095) skeleton. ⚠️ No autonomous wake-loop in this env (no
  ScheduleWakeup/Cron/Monitor); Tier-2 (real models/deploy/tokens) needs a networked host.

## Key docs

- Spec: [`docs/V1-BUILD-SPEC.md`](docs/V1-BUILD-SPEC.md) (v1.2, verification table, D1–D7)
- Plan: [`docs/V1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](docs/V1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) (6 phases; Steps 1–4 done)
- Verified results: [`docs/FOUNDATION-WAVE1-RESULT.md`](docs/FOUNDATION-WAVE1-RESULT.md)
- Spikes (verified GO): `spike/oauth/RESULT.md` (R1 better-auth), `spike/crypto/RESULT.md` (D3/D4/D6)

## Standing disciplines (see CLAUDE.md)

- Verify every step with running code before building on it; never claim green without
  watching the ledger reach `VERDICT … EXIT=0`.
- Run tasks to completion; fold sweep findings in rather than pausing.
